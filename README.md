# MAG7-Portfolio-Risk-Analysis-A-PCA-Copula-Approach
This project presents a comprehensive risk management framework tailored for a portfolio of seven leading technology stocks—AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, NFLX, and TSLA (the "MAG7"). The methodology integrates custom Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction with a Gaussian copula to capture and simulate the complex dependence structure among asset returns. Historical return data are transformed into a lower-dimensional space by extracting the top three principal components, which are then used to estimate the copula’s correlation structure. Simulated returns are generated through the copula, enabling the computation of key risk metrics, namely Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). The framework is further enhanced by a portfolio optimization module that adjusts asset weights under long-only constraints to minimize tail risk. The performance and risk profiles of both historical and optimized simulated portfolios are visualized and compared, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed approach in capturing market dynamics and improving risk assessment. This integrated strategy offers valuable insights for financial risk management in volatile market conditions.
